# Godland OpenSourse

Hello, developer! We are pleased to offer you the template of our OpenSourse page!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Due to the fact that this template is completely free, we wish you coming across with challenge of its downloading. Go to the Installing section for more details but before – please visit [this page](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to download Git, that will be soon required.

### Installing

Ugh, you have done a great job so far by reaching the Installing section. So as you have downloaded Git – lets access your Desktop to *clone* the files. Open up your **Git Bash** and type:

```
cd Desktop
```

However, your goal is to access the Desktop directory (this is how I do it on my computer) and whether it didnt work – try to find your one or contact us!

Now lets clone these files to your *local repository*. Local repository is a storage on your local machine – e.g computer. Type this code to *clone* the files from *Remote repository* e.g GitHub.

```
$git clone https://github.com/alexawa/guide.git godlandDev
```

By saying *clone*, you ask **Git** to clone all the files of a link that comes further, 'download' them to a directory of Desktop, that we accessed above and pass them to a folder called *godlandDev*. Now, you gained all our OpenSource files, congratilations!
